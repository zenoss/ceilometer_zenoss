The purpose of the 'dist' branch is to hold a copy of the released binaries (RPMs).

All RPMs should be posted here as well as under 'releases'.  The reason for this
is that a regular release URL:

https://github.com/zenoss/ceilometer_zenoss/releases/download/1.2.0/ceilometer_zenoss-1.2.0-1.el7.noarch.rpm

could not be downloaded by an existing mechanism (DeployArtifactURLs in a heat
template) that uses curl without the commandline option that causes it to follow
redirects.  (in this case, github redirects to a s3 URL).

By posting the binaries on this branch, they can be downloaded, without a redirect, as

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenoss/ceilometer_zenoss/dist/ceilometer_zenoss-1.2.0-1.el7.noarch.rpm
